# Stream Commander #

This is a work in progress project for a custom system that allows 
video and audio to be played on a stream via a browser source in the 
OBS scene.
Additionally, this leverages the control features of the [obs-browser](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-browser)
implementation to allow commands to be sent to OBS to change scenes.
